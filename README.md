# Demand-forecasting-and-product-planning

**Domain: Supply Chain Management**

**Project Description**

This project aims to advance demand forecasting and product planning using a hybrid machine learning model combining ARIMA and SARIMA techniques. By accurately predicting future demand, businesses can optimize inventory management, reduce excess inventory costs, and ensure better production planning.

We developed Insightify, a user-friendly mobile application, enabling businesses to input product data, analyze trends, and make data-driven decisions for distribution and stocking strategies. The hybrid forecasting model enhances prediction accuracy, empowering organizations to proactively adjust production schedules and capitalize on emerging market trends.

**Key Features**

**Hybrid Forecasting Model:**

Combines results of ARIMA and SARIMA models using a weightage method for higher accuracy.

**ARIMA Metrics:**

MAE: 4.645 | MSE: 29.047 | RMSE: 5.390

**SARIMA Metrics:**

MAE: 4.648 | MSE: 29.106 | RMSE: 5.395

**Customer Segmentation:**

Implements RFM segmentation to analyze customer recency, frequency, and monetary value.

Provides actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, improve customer retention, and maximize revenue.

**Application Framework:**

Developed an intuitive React.js application:

Users can input product data and analyze results.

Generates forecasts based on historical data.

**Model Evaluation and Data Preparation:**

    Data collected from Kaggle.
    
    **Processed data with steps including:**
    
        Missing value removal and data cleaning.
        
        EDA to analyze the impact of attributes on demand.
        
        Conversion of categorical variables into numerical format.
        
        Data split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

**Advanced Time Series and Recommendation Techniques:**

The model integrates time-dependent trends and user-item interactions for improved forecasting and tailored recommendations.
